get weapons with classes run this in debug console

All i had to do was change Exile_ to the other mod, so example for RHS weapons

I changed Exile_ to rhs_weap_ because i was able to see 1 classname and knew this is what the class started with.

A person could change this up a bit to also export classnames of

CfgVehicles, CfgAmmo, CfgMagazines, CfgWeapons, CfgGroups, CfgVehicleClasses, CfgFactionClasses etc
